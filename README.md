## 🚜 Problem Statement

Farmers often make farming decisions without real-time, data-driven insights, leading to:
- Poor crop planning  
- Inefficient resource usage  
- Reduced income and profits  

They rely on:
- Physical shops for agricultural inputs  
- Middlemen to sell produce  
- Digital tools that are not available in regional languages  

This limits access to timely guidance, transparency, and fair pricing.
